# RIT Computer Science House
CSH is a collection of students interested in creating projects and learning new things. The open and accepting community along with the highly available resources here create a learning environment that is unmatched anywhere else. I have begun working on various personal projects here.

# OpenGL/OpenCV Demo
![Screenshot](csh_openglcv.png){style="width:100%;display:block;"}

* Learned fundamental concepts of OpenGL as part of a 24 hour hackathon.
* Uses OpenCV to capture from a webcam and output to a OpenGL texture.
* Tracks squares of a certain color using OpenCV and moves OpenGL objects accordingly.
* Intended to be a proof of concept for a virtual environment for tabletop games.
