<p>I've always loved playing with LEGOs. Some of my earliest memories involve building imaginary robots out of LEGOs on a big red table. Eventually I started building working robots with a LEGO Mindstorm NXT kit that my parents got me. And now I'm at RIT for computer engineering looking for ways to build real robots. Even though I'm at college, I'm still in the 4-99 year old range that is perfect for playing with LEGOs. Although now I've found more organized uses for LEGOs.</p>
<p>One of the ways I've been putting my LEGOs to use is a color-coded LEGO schedule. I can quantify the amount of time I spend on something by looking at how much of each color LEGO is on the calendar. Because it's made of LEGOs, my schedule is always malleable. I can move a block around to account for anything unexpected. However, since every block needs to go somewhere, I can make sure that I'm take the time I need for each project.</p>
<p>However, I find it difficult to keep up with a schedule if I can't see it. Since my LEGO schedule isn't exactly portable, I made a way to automatically crop and correct a photo of my calendar to just show the bricks. I used OpenCV to filter, detect, and warp the images.</p>

    An example of a picture of my schedule, and the output of my program.

<p>An overview of my thought process started with finding an effective way to filter out only the green color of the LEGO backplane. Then I used some code from an OpenCV tutorial to find the largest blob of that color. After that, I came up with a simple way to approximate the four corners of the backplane. Using those four corners as anchor points, I can finally use the OpenCV perspective warp function to fit the backplane into it's own image.</p>
<p>Eventually I may look into a way to digitize these images into a format that I can add to a calendar app. But for now, I'm just going to keep playing with LEGOs.</p>
<h2>2017-05-05 Update: Can Detect Brick Colors</h2>
<p>Recently I added another program to the repository for this project. This program takes in the output of the previous program, and uses hue and saturation histograms to categorize each cell by color. I'm going to put this project on hold for a while at this point.</p>

    But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to
    the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston,
    a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this
    football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not
    yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several
    times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a
    precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment
    needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and
    survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and
    then return it safely to earth, re-entering the atmosphere at
    speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that
    of the temperature of the sun - almost as hot as it is here today
    - and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this
    decade is out - then we must be bold.
