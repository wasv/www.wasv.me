<p>One of the projects I was working on over a few weeks in spring of 2017 was a z80 homebrew computer. I call it <a href="https://github.com/wasv/wz80" target="_blank">wz80</a>, short for wasv's z80. Most of the construction of the computer was done during one of <a href="https://csh.rit.edu/" target="_blank" title="Computer Science House">CSH</a>'s weekend hackathon. Although, I designed the schematics a few days ahead of time.</p>
<p>The layout and modular design is based on Semachthemonkey's <a href="http://rc2014.co.uk/" target="_blank">RC2014</a> project. However, instead of building a separate backplane and CPU boad, I put the CPU and reset button on the backplane.</p>
<p>I left room to add a clock circuit in the future. Currently the clock signal is generated by a 555 timer. This makes debugging the hardware much easier. I actually managed to debug a program while it was running by attaching some LEDs to the data lines and turning the clock speed way down. I wrote down each byte as it appeared, and then disassembled the instructions by hand. In the end I had a working z80 computer that could cycle through the LEDs on a 7-segment display.</p>
<p>A few notes for anyone else who wants to build a homebrew computer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start small</strong> This isn't the first time I wanted to build a homebrew computer. But it is the first time I managed to design and build one. I intentionally chose a good starting design, and stripped it down to the minimum set of necessary features.</li>
<li><strong>One thing at a time.</strong> Freerun the CPU first, then add a ROM, then basic IO, then RAM.</li>
<li><strong>Know how you will be storing programs.</strong> I ordered a few inexpensive flash chips without realizing how expensive flash programmers were. As a result, <a href="https://github.com/wasv/wz80/tree/master/flashprog" target="_blank">I tried to make my own</a> then ended up using <a href="https://github.com/wasv/wz80/tree/master/rom-core" target="_blank">a FPGA as a ROM</a> instead.</li>
<li>As one of my engineering professors said, <strong>"don't draw more lines in the morning than you can erase in the afternoon."</strong> I'd like to add that after 8 PM counts as morning.
<br>
I made a change to my reset circuit around 8 PM, and soldered it later than night. By the time I finished assembling the board around 1 AM, I spent another two hours trying to figure out why all the outputs were being held high. After looking at the datasheet, I realized the issue was that change I added.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 
    But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to
    the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston,
    a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this
    football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not
    yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several
    times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a
    precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment
    needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and
    survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and
    then return it safely to earth, re-entering the atmosphere at
    speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that
    of the temperature of the sun - almost as hot as it is here today
    - and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this
    decade is out - then we must be bold.
