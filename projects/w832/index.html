<p>Learning how emulators and assemblers work with a fictional architecture.</p>

<p>I spent some time this past summer and spring working on learning the basics of designing an instruction set.
I didn't formally learn these topics for a year or two in my college.
However, I found myself with enough time to design an emulator and assembler for a fictional
instruction set that I designed based on the architecture of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine" target="_blank">Manchester SSEM</a>
The instruction set is named W832, short for "WASV's 8-bit, 32-address Instruction Set".</p>
<p>The process of deciding on an architecture was essentially a really long <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/214" target="_blank">Wikipeida Rabbit Hole</a>
ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_instruction_set" target="_blank">orthogonality</a>
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer" target="_blank">one instruction set architectures</a>.
The one instruction architectures were very useful to look at as an example of the bare minimum needed for a useful instruction set.
Eventually I got my instruction set down to 8 instructions, leaving 5 bits to address 32 bytes of memory.
I might also make a W816 instruction set with support for immediate operands, however this would reduce the address bits to 4, leaving only 16 bytes to address memory.</p>
<p>I also have a JavaScript emulator for a different architecture, <a href="https://github.com/wasv/c1616-js" target="_blank">C1616</a>.
C1616 is an extension of Daniel Bailey's <a href="https://github.com/danieljabailey/C88" target="_blank">C88</a>, which was also based on the SSEM.
I've found that either W832 or C88 can be useful in learning the basics programming in an assembly language, without the need to have dedicated hardware.</p>

<!-- 
    But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to
    the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston,
    a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this
    football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not
    yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several
    times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a
    precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment
    needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and
    survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and
    then return it safely to earth, re-entering the atmosphere at
    speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that
    of the temperature of the sun - almost as hot as it is here today
    - and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this
    decade is out - then we must be bold.
